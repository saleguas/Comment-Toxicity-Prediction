# Toxicity Prediction of Online Comments with Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models

I was one of 40 students in the entire state of Florida accepted into the [2018 Young Scholars Program](https://www.bio.fsu.edu/ysp/) at Florida State University, a six-week residential science and mathematics summer program for highschoolers with significant potential for careers in STEM-oriented fields.

During my time there, I worked on an indepndent research project (IRP) with [Dr. Weikuan Yu](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~yuw/) as a supervising professor on a natural language processing (NLP) task. My goal was to create models to better predict the toxicity of and classify toxic (e.g. rude or disrespectful) comments in the setting of an online community. The code created and used for this purpose is documented in this repository.

Research Paper: TBD
